2. ManPageView Usage				*manpageview-usage* {{{1

        GENERAL FORMAT				*manpageview-format* {{{2

		(command) :[count][HORV]Man [topic] [booknumber]
		(map)     [count]K

	MAN						*manpageview-man* {{{2
>
	:[count]Man topic
	:Man topic booknumber
	:Man booknumber topic
	:Man topic(booknumber)
	:Man      -- will restore position prior to use of :Man
	             (only for g:manpageview_winopen == "only")
<
	Put cursor on topic, press "K" while in normal mode.
	(This works if (a) you've not mapped some other key
	to <Plug>ManPageView, and (b) if |'keywordprg'| is "man",
	which it is by default)

	If a count is present (ie. 7K), the count will be used
	as the booknumber.

	If your "man" command requires options, you may specify them
	with the g:manpageview_options variable in your <.vimrc>.


	OPENING STYLE				*manpageview-open* {{{2

	In addition, one may specify open help and specify an
	opening style (see g:manpageview_winopen below): >

		:[count]HMan topic     -- g:manpageview_winopen= "hsplit"
		:[count]HEMan topic    -- g:manpageview_winopen= "hsplit="
		:[count]VMan topic     -- g:manpageview_winopen= "vsplit"
		:[count]VEMan topic    -- g:manpageview_winopen= "vsplit="
		:[count]OMan topic     -- g:manpageview_winopen= "osplit"
		:[count]RMan topic     -- g:manpageview_winopen= "reuse"
<
	To support perl, manpageview now can switch to using perldoc
	instead of man.  In fact, the facility is generalized to
	allow multiple help viewing systems.

	INFO					*manpageview-info* {{{2

	Info pages are supported by appending a ".i" suffix: >
		:Man info.i
<	A number of maps are provided: >
		MAP	EFFECT
		> n	go to next node
		< p	go to previous node
		d       go to the top-level directory
		u	go to up node
		t	go to top node
		H	give help
		i	ask for "index" help
		<bs>    go up one page
		<del>   go up one page
		<tab>   go to next hyperlink
<
	The "index" help isn't currently using index information; instead,
	its doing some searching in the various info files.  The "," and ";"
	operators are provided to go to the next and previous matches,
	respectively.

	K MAP					*manpageview-K* {{{2
>
		[count]K
<
	ManPageView also supports the use of "K", as a map, to
	invoke ManPageView.  The topic is taken from the word
	currently under the cursor.  If a [count] is present, it
	will be used as the booknumber.

	PERL					*manpageview-perl* {{{2

	For perl, the following command, >
		:Man sprintf.pl
<	will bring up the perldoc version of sprintf.  The perl
	support includes a "path" of options to use with perldoc: >
		g:manpageview_options_pl= ";-f;-q"
<	Thus just the one suffix (.pl) with manpageview handles
	embedded perl documentation, perl builtin functions, and
	perl FAQ keywords.

	If the filetype is "perl", which is determined by vim
	for syntax highlighting, the ".pl" suffix may be dropped.
	For example, when editing a "abc.pl" file, >
		:Man sprintf
<	will return the perl help for sprintf.

	PHP					*manpageview-php* {{{2

	For php help, Manpageview uses links to get help from
	http://www.php.net (by default).  The filetype as determined
	for syntax highlighting is used to signal manpageview to use
	php help.  As an example, >
		:Man bzopen.php
<	will get help for php's bzopen command.  When one is editing
	a php file, then man will default to getting help for php
	(ie. when the filetype is php, :Man bzopen will get the help
	for php's bzopen).

	Manpageview uses "links -dump http://www.php.net/TOPIC" by
	default; hence, to obtain help for php you need to have a
	copy of the links WWW browser.  The homepage for Elinks is
	http://elinks.cz/.


	EXTENDING MANPAGEVIEW			*manpageview-extend* {{{2

	To extend manpageview to handle other documentation systems,
	manpageview has some special variables with a common extension: >

		g:manpageview_pgm_{ext}
		g:manpageview_options_{ext}
		g:manpageview_sfx_{ext}
<
	For perl, the {ext} is ".pl", and the variables are set to: >

     	     let g:manpageview_pgm_pl     = "perldoc"
     	     let g:manpageview_options_pl = ";-f;-q"
<
	For info, that {ext} is ".i", and the extension variables are
	set to: >

     	     let g:manpageview_pgm_i     = "info"
     	     let g:manpageview_options_i = "--output=-"
     	     let g:manpageview_syntax_i  = "info"
     	     let g:manpageview_K_i       = "<sid>ManPageInfo(0)"
     	     let g:manpageview_init_i    = "call ManPageInfoInit()"
<
	The help on |manpageview_extend| covers these variables in more
	detail.

	MULTIPLE MAN PAGES		*manpage-pageup* *manpage-pagedown*

        With >
		man -a topic
<	one may get multiple man pages in a single buffer.  Manpageview
	provides two maps to facilitate moving amongst these pages: >

		PageUp  : move to preceding  manpage
		PageDown: move to succeeding manpage
<

==============================================================================
3. ManPageView Options				*manpageview-options* {{{1

						*g:manpageview_iconv*
	g:manpageview_iconv   : some systems seem to include unwanted
		    characters. The iconv program can be used to filter out
		    such characters; by default, manpageview will use >
			iconv -c
<		    You may avoid manpageview's use of iconv by putting: >
			let g:manpageview_iconv= ""
<		    in your <.vimrc> file; you may also specify any other
		    filter you wish with this variable.  Also, if iconv
		    happens to not be |executable()|, then no filtering
		    will be done.  (Thanks to Matthew Wozniski).

						*g:manpageview_multimanpage*
	g:manpageview_multimanpage (=1 by default)
		    This option means that the PageUp and PageDown keys
		    will be mapped to move to the next and previous manpage
		    in a multi-man-page buffer.  Such buffers result with
		    the "man -a" option.  As an example: >
		    	:Man -a printf
<
						*g:manpageview_options*
	g:manpageview_options : extra options that will be passed on when
	                        invoking the man command
	  examples:
	            let g:manpageview_options= "-P 'cat -'"
	            let g:manpageview_options= "-c"
	            let g:manpageview_options= "-Tascii"
	
						*g:manpageview_pgm*
	g:manpageview_pgm : by default, its "man", but it may be changed
		     by the user.  This program is what is called to actually
		     extract the manpage.

						*g:manpageview_winopen*
	g:manpageview_winopen : may take on one of six values:

	   "only"    man page will become sole window.
	             Side effect: All windows' contents will be saved first!
		     (windo w) Use :q to terminate the manpage and restore the
		     window setup.  Note that mksession is used for this
		     option, hence the +mksession configure-option is required.
	   "hsplit"  man page will appear in a horizontally          split window (default)
	   "vsplit"  man page will appear in a vertically            split window
	   "hsplit=" man page will appear in a horizontally & evenly split window
	   "vsplit=" man page will appear in a vertically   & evenly split window
	   "reuse"   man page will re-use current window.  Use <ctrl-o> to return.
	             (for the reuse option, thanks go to Alan Schmitt)
	
				*g:manpageview_server* *g:manpgeview_user*
						
	g:manpageview_server : for WinNT; uses rsh to read manpage remotely
	g:manpageview_user   : use given server (host) and username
	  examples:
	            let g:manpageview_server= "somehostname"
	            let g:manpageview_user  = "username"

	*g:manpageview_init_EXT* *g:manpageview_K_EXT*   *g:manpageview_options_EXT*
	*g:manpageview_pfx_EXT*  *g:manpageview_pgm_EXT* *g:manpageview_sfx_EXT*
	*g:manpageview_syntax_EXT*
	g:manpageview_init_{ext}:			*manpageview_extend*
	g:manpageview_K_{ext}:
	g:manpageview_options_{ext}:
	g:manpageview_pfx_{ext}:
	g:manpageview_pgm_{ext}:
	g:manpageview_sfx_{ext}:
	g:manpageview_syntax_{ext}:

		With these options, one may specify an extension on a topic
		and have a special program and customized options for that
		program used instead of man itself.  As an example, consider
		perl: >

			let g:manpageview_pgm_pl = "perldoc"
			let g:manpageview_options= ";-f;-q"
<
		Note that, for perl, the options consist of a sequence of
		options to be tried, separated by semi-colons.

		The g:manpageview_init_{ext} specifies a function to be called
		for initialization.  The info handler, for example, uses this
		function to specify buffer-local maps.

		The g:manpageview_K_{ext} specifies a function to be invoked
		when the "K" key is tapped.  By default, it calls
		s:ManPageView().

		The g:manpageview_options_{ext} specifies what options are
		needed.

		The g:manpageview_pfx_{ext} specifies a prefix to prepend to
		the nominal manpage name.

		The g:manpageview_pgm_{ext} specifies which program to run for
		help.

		The g:manpageview_sfx_{ext} specifies a suffix to append to
		the nominal manpage name.  Without this last option, the
		provided suffix (ie. Man sprintf.pl 's  ".pl") will be elided.
		With this option, the g:manpageview_sfx_{ext} will be
		appended.

		The g:manpageview_syntax_{ext} specifies a highlighting file
		to be used for this particular extension type.

	You may map some key other than "K" to invoke ManPageView; as an
	example: >
		nmap V <Plug>ManPageView
<	Put this in your <.vimrc>.

4. ManPageView History				*manpageview-history* {{{1

	Thanks go to the various people who have contributed changes,
	pointed out problems, and made suggestions!

	v22: Nov 10, 2008  * if g:manpageview_K_{ext} (ext is some
			     extension) exists, previously that would
			     be enough to institute a K map.  Now, if
			     that string is "", then the K map will not
			     be generated.
	     Nov 17, 2008  * handles non-existing manpage requests better
	v21: Sep 11, 2008  * when at a top node with info help, the up
			     directory shows as "(dir)".  A "u" issued a
			     warning and closes the window.  It now issues
			     a warning but leaves the window unchanged.
			   * improved shellescape() use
			   * new option: g:manpageview_multimanpage
	     Sep 27, 2008  * The K map now uses <cword> expansion except when
			     used inside a manpage (where it uses <cWORD>).
	v19: Jun 06, 2008  * uses the shellescape() function for better
			     security.  Thus vim 7.1 is required.
			   * when shellescape() isn't available, manpageview
			     will only issue a warning message when invoked
			     instead of every time vim is invoked.
			   * syntax/manphp.vim was using "set" instead of
			     "setlocal" and so new buffers were inadvertently
			     being prevented from being modifiable.
	     Aug 05, 2008  * fixed a problem with using K multiple times with
			     php files
	v18: Jun 06, 2008  * <PageUp> and <PageDown> support added to jump
			     between multiple man pages loaded into one buffer
			     such as may occur with :Man -a printf
			   * links -dump used instead of links for php
	v17: Apr 18, 2007  * changed the topic cleanup to use 'g' instead
	                     of '' in the substitute().
			   * Fixed bug with info pages - wasn't able to
			     use the > and < maps to go to pages named
			     with spaces.
			   * Included the g:manpageview_iconv option
	     Sep 07, 2007  * viewing window now is read-only and swapfile
	                     is turned off
	     Sep 07, 2007  * The "::" in some help pages (ex. File::stat)
			     was being parsed out, leaving only the left
			     hand side word.  Manpageview now accepts them.
	     Nov 12, 2007  * At the request of F. Mehner, with
			     g:manpageview_winopen is "reuse", manpageview
			     will re-use any man-page windows that are still
			     open.
			   * (F.Mehner) in "reuse" mode, a K on a blank
			     character terminated vim.  Fixed!
	     May 09, 2008  * Added <PageUp> and <PageDown> maps
	v16: Jun 28, 2006  * bypasses sxq with '"' for windows internally
	     Sep 26, 2006  * implemented <count>K to look up a topic
	                     under the cursor but in the <count>-th book
	     Nov 21, 2006  * removed s:mank related code; man -k being
	                     handled without it.
	     Dec 04, 2006  * added fdc=0 to manpageview settings bypass
	     Feb 21, 2007  * removed modifications to isk; instead,
	                     manpageview attempts to fix the topic and
			     uses expand("<cWORD>") instead:w
	v15: Jan 23, 2006  * works around nomagic option
	                   * works around cwh=1 to avoid Hit-Enter prompts
	     Feb 13, 2006  * the test for keywordprg was for "man"; now its
	                     for a regular expression "^man\>" (so its
	        	     immune to the use of options)
	     Apr 11, 2006  * HMan, OMan, VMan, Rman commands implemented
	     Jun 27, 2006  * escaped any spaces coming from tempname()
	v14: Nov 23, 2005  * "only" was occasionally issuing an "Already one
	                     window" message, which is now prevented
	     Nov 29, 2005  * Aaron Griffin found that setting gdefault
	        	     gave manpageview problems with ctrl-hs.  Fixed.
	     Dec 16, 2005  * Suresh Govindachar asked about letting
	                     manpageview also handle perldoc -q manpages.
	        	     IMHO this was getting cumbersome, so I extended
	        	     opt to allow a semi-colon separated "path" of
	        	     up to three options to try.
	     Dec 20, 2005  * In consultation with Gareth Oakes, manpageview
	                     needed some quoting and backslash-fixes to work
	        	     properly with windows and perldoc.
	     Dec 29, 2005  * added links-based help for php functions

	v13: Jul 19, 2005  * included niebie's changes to manpageview -
	                     <bs>, <del> to scroll one page up,
	        	     <tab> to go to the next hyperlink
	        	     d     to go to the top-level directory
	        	     and some bugfixes ([] to \[ \], and redirecting
	        	     stderr to /dev/null by default)
	     Aug 17, 2005  * report option workaround
	     Sep 26, 2005  * :Man -k  now uses "man -k" to generate a keyword
	                     listing
	        	   * included syntax/man.vim and syntax/mankey.vim
	v12: Jul 11, 2005  unmap K was causing "noise" when it was first
			   used.  Fixed.
	v11: * K now <buffer>-mapped to call ManPageView()
	v10: * support for perl/perldoc:
	      g:manpageview_{ pgm | options | sfx }_{ extension }
	    * support for info: g:manpageview_{ K | pfx | syntax }
	    * configuration option drilling -- if you're in a
	      *.conf file, pressing "K" atop an option will go
	      to the associated help page and option, if there's
	      help for that configuration file
	v9: * for vim versions >= 6.3, keepjumps is used to reduce the
	      impact on the jumplist
	    * manpageview now turns off linewrap for the manpage, since
	      re-formatting doesn't seem to work usually.
	    * apparently some systems resize the [g]vim display when
	      any filter is used, including manpageview's :r!... .
	      Setting g:manpageview_dispresize=1 will force retention
	      of display size.
	    * before mapping K to use manpageview, a check that
	      keywordprg is "man" is also made. (tnx to Suresh Govindachar)
	v8: * apparently bh=wipe is "new", so I've put a version
	      test around that setting to allow older vim's to avoid
	      an error message
	    * manpageview now turns numbering off in the manpage buffer (nonu)
	v7: * when a manpageview window is exit'd, it will be wiped out
	      so that it doesn't clutter the buffer list
	    * when g:manpageview_winopen was "reuse", the manpage would
	      reuse the window, even when it wasn't a manpage window.
	      Manpageview will now use hsplit if the window was marked
	      "modified"; otherwise, the associated buffer will be marked
	      as "hidden" (so that its still available via the buffer list)
	v6: * Erik Remmelzwal provided a fix to the g:manpageview_server
	      support for NT
	    * implemented Erik's suggestion to re-use manpage windows
	    * Nathan Huizinga pointed out, <cWORD> was picking up too much for
	      the K map. <cword> is now used
	    * Denilson F de Sa suggested that the man-page window be set as
	      readonly and nonmodifiable

	v5: includes g:manpageview_winmethod option (only, hsplit, vsplit)

	v4: Erik Remmelzwaal suggested including, for the benefit of NT users,
	    a command to use rsh to read the manpage remotely.  Set
	    g:manpageview_server to hostname  (in your <.vimrc>)
	    g:manpageview_user   to username

	v3: * ignores (...) if it contains commas or double quotes.  elides
	      any commas, colons, and semi-colons at end

	    * g:manpageview_options supported

	v2: saves current session prior to invoking man pages :Man    will
	    restore session.  Requires +mksession for this new command to
	    work.

	v1: the epoch
